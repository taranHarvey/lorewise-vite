# âœ… AI Diff System - Connection Complete!

## ðŸŽ‰ Everything is Connected and Ready!

Your Lorewise novel writing application now has a fully functional Cursor-like AI diff system integrated with your existing OpenAI service.

---

## What We Connected

### Your Existing AI Service â†’ Diff System

**Your AI Service** (`src/services/aiService.ts`)
- âœ… Already had the perfect structure
- âœ… `getInlineEdits()` method returns structured edits
- âœ… Supports all 8 AI action modes
- âœ… Handles context and lore automatically
- âœ… Returns `AIEditResponse` format (exactly what diff system needs!)

**Connected via** (`src/components/AI/AIEditToolbar.tsx`)
- âœ… Toolbar component that calls `aiService.getInlineEdits()`
- âœ… Gets user selection from editor
- âœ… Extracts context (500 chars before/after)
- âœ… Includes lore for consistency
- âœ… Passes AI response to diff system

**Diff System** (`src/hooks/useDiffEditor.ts`)
- âœ… Receives AI edits
- âœ… Applies as visual highlights in editor
- âœ… Shows in sidebar for review
- âœ… Handles accept/reject actions

---

## Integration Points

### 1. TiptapEditor (`src/components/TiptapEditor/TiptapEditor.tsx`)

**Added:**
```typescript
// At the top
import { AIEditToolbar } from '../AI/AIEditToolbar';

// In the render
<AIEditToolbar editor={editor} lore={lore} />
```

**Result:** Toolbar appears at top of book editor with 8 AI action buttons

### 2. LoreEditor (`src/components/LoreEditor/LoreEditor.tsx`)

**Added:**
```typescript
// At the top
import { AIEditToolbar } from '../AI/AIEditToolbar';

// In the render
<AIEditToolbar editor={editor} lore={lore || undefined} />
```

**Result:** Same toolbar in lore editor for consistent experience

### 3. Main App (`src/main.tsx`)

**Added:**
```typescript
import './styles/diff-highlights.css'
```

**Result:** Inline diff highlighting styles loaded globally

## How It Works - Data Flow

```
1. User selects text in editor
   â†“
2. User clicks AI action button (e.g., "Improve")
   â†“
3. AIEditToolbar.tsx captures:
   - Selected text
   - Context before (500 chars)
   - Context after (500 chars)
   - Lore document
   â†“
4. Calls aiService.getInlineEdits() with:
   {
     selection: "selected text",
     contextBefore: "...",
     contextAfter: "...",
     references: [{ title: "Series Lore", content: "..." }],
     mode: "improve"
   }
   â†“
5. AI Service (aiService.ts):
   - Builds prompt with context + lore
   - Calls OpenAI API
   - Returns structured edits
   {
     success: true,
     edits: [
       {
         id: "edit-123",
         type: "replace",
         range: { start: 0, end: 10 },
         oldText: "original",
         newText: "improved",
         rationale: "why this is better"
       }
     ]
   }
   â†“
6. useDiffEditor.processAIResponse():
   - Receives AI edits
   - Applies DiffExtension marks to editor
   - Updates pendingChanges state
   â†“
7. UI Updates:
   - Editor shows colored highlights (green/red/yellow)
   - DiffVisualization sidebar appears
   - Shows all changes with rationale
   â†“
8. User Reviews:
   - Clicks "Accept" or "Reject"
   - Or uses keyboard shortcuts
   â†“
9. useDiffEditor.acceptChange() / rejectChange():
   - Applies or reverts the change
   - Removes from pendingChanges
   - Updates editor content
   â†“
10. Final Result: Document updated with accepted changes
```

## What You Can Do Now

### âœ… Ready to Use Immediately

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open any document** in the editor

3. **Select some text** (highlight a sentence or paragraph)

4. **Click any AI action button:**
   - Improve
   - Expand
   - Shorten
   - Rephrase
   - Continue
   - Check (consistency)
   - Dialogue
   - Describe

5. **Review the changes** in the diff sidebar

---

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Quick Test

1. [ ] Start dev server (`npm run dev`)
2. [ ] Verify OpenAI API key is in `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
   ```
3. [ ] Navigate to a book document
4. [ ] Look for the AI toolbar at the top (should have 8 buttons)
5. [ ] Select a sentence in the editor
6. [ ] Click "Improve" button
7. [ ] Wait 3-5 seconds for AI to process
8. [ ] Look for diff sidebar on the right
9. [ ] See highlighted changes in the editor
10. [ ] Click "Accept" on a change
11. [ ] Verify the change was applied
12. [ ] Try keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+A`

### Expected Behavior

**When you click an AI action:**
- Toolbar shows "Processing with AI..." message
- Button becomes active (highlighted)
- After 3-10 seconds, diff sidebar appears
- Editor shows color-coded highlights:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green with underline = additions
  - ðŸ”´ Red with strikethrough = deletions
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow with underline = replacements
- Sidebar lists each change with:
  - Change type (Addition/Deletion/Replacement)
  - Old text â†’ New text
  - Rationale from AI
  - Accept/Reject buttons

**When you accept a change:**
- Change is applied to document
- Highlight disappears
- Change removed from sidebar
- If no more changes, sidebar closes

**When you reject a change:**
- Change is removed
- Original text restored (if applicable)
- Change removed from sidebar
- If no more changes, sidebar closes

## Customization

### Change Button Colors

Edit `src/components/AI/AIEditToolbar.tsx`:

```typescript
const AI_ACTIONS: AIAction[] = [
  {
    mode: 'improve',
    label: 'Improve',
    icon: <Edit3 size={16} />,
    description: 'Refine tone, flow, and clarity',
    color: '#6496ff', // Change this!
  },
  // ...
];
```

### Change Diff Highlight Colors

Edit `src/styles/diff-highlights.css`:

```css
/* Insert (additions) */
.ProseMirror .diff-change[data-change-type='insert'] {
  background: rgba(100, 255, 100, 0.2); /* Change green */
  border-bottom: 2px solid #64ff64;
}
```

### Add Custom AI Action

1. Add to type in `src/services/aiService.ts`:
```typescript
export type AIActionMode =
  | 'improve'
  | 'expand'
  // ... existing
  | 'yourCustomAction'; // Add this
```

2. Add instructions:
```typescript
private getInlineEditModeInstructions(mode: AIActionMode): string {
  const instructions: Record<AIActionMode, string> = {
    // ... existing
    yourCustomAction: 'Your custom instructions here',
  };
  return instructions[mode];
}
```

3. Add button in `src/components/AI/AIEditToolbar.tsx`:
```typescript
const AI_ACTIONS: AIAction[] = [
  // ... existing
  {
    mode: 'yourCustomAction',
    label: 'Custom',
    icon: <YourIcon size={16} />,
    description: 'What it does',
    color: '#ff6496',
  },
];
```

## Troubleshooting

### Toolbar doesn't appear
- Make sure you imported `AIEditToolbar` in your editor
- Check console for import errors
- Verify editor instance is available

### No changes suggested
- Check your OpenAI API key
- Check browser console for errors
- Check network tab for API call status
- Verify your API quota/rate limits

### Changes appear but can't accept
- Check if `useDiffEditor` hook is initialized
- Check if `DiffExtension` is in editor extensions
- Look for console errors

### Styles don't look right
- Verify `diff-highlights.css` is imported in `main.tsx`
- Check if SCSS is compiling (look for `AIEditToolbar.scss`)
- Clear browser cache

## Summary

ðŸŽ‰ **The connection is complete!**

Your existing AI service (`aiService.ts`) now powers a visual diff system with:
- âœ… 8 AI editing actions
- âœ… Context-aware suggestions
- âœ… Lore consistency checking
- âœ… Accept/reject workflow
- âœ… Keyboard shortcuts
- âœ… Beautiful UI with rationale

**No changes needed to your AI service** - it already had the perfect structure!

We just created:
1. The toolbar component (`AIEditToolbar`) to trigger actions
2. The diff system to visualize changes
3. The glue code to connect them

**It works in both:**
- TiptapEditor (book documents)
- LoreEditor (lore documents)

## Next Steps

1. **Test it out** - Select text and try the actions!
2. **Customize** - Adjust colors, add actions, tweak prompts
3. **Write** - Use AI to enhance your novel writing
4. **Iterate** - Give feedback, make improvements
