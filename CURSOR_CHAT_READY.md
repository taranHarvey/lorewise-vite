# ✅ Cursor-Style Chat - Implementation Complete!

## 🎉 What's New

I've implemented a streamlined, Cursor-style AI chat interface focused on your core feature: **AI-assisted content generation**.

## Files Created

1. **`src/components/AI/CursorStyleChat.tsx`** - Main chat component
2. **`src/components/AI/CursorStyleChat.scss`** - Styling
3. **`CURSOR_CHAT_GUIDE.md`** - Complete user guide

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/AI/ResizableAIPanel.tsx`** - Now uses CursorStyleChat

## How It Works

### Simple Workflow

```
1. You prompt AI → "Write a battle scene"
2. AI generates content
3. You see 3 buttons:
   [×Decline] [⟳Revise] [✓Accept]
4. Choose:
   - Accept → Inserts at cursor position
   - Decline → Skip it
   - Revise → Give feedback, AI tries again
```

## Key Features

### ✅ Accept
- Inserts content at current cursor position
- Marks message as accepted
- Shows confirmation

### ❌ Decline
- Rejects the suggestion
- Marks message as declined
- Nothing inserted

### 🔄 Revise (Feedback Loop)
- Click "Revise"
- Type feedback: "Make it darker" / "Add more dialogue" / etc.
- AI generates improved version
- New version appears with same options
- **Can revise multiple times!**

## Context Awareness

The AI automatically considers:

1. **Cursor Position** - Knows where to insert
2. **Surrounding Text** - 500 chars before/after cursor
3. **Series Lore** - Your world-building document
4. **Your Prompt** - What you specifically asked for

## UI Preview

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🗨 AI Assistant              [×]   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  💬 You: Write an opening scene    │
│                                     │
│  🤖 AI: The rain fell in sheets... │
│     ...epic content...              │
│                                     │
│     [×Decline] [⟳Revise] [✓Accept] │
│                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Technical Implementation

### Insert at Cursor
```typescript
const { from } = editor.state.selection;
editor.chain().focus().insertContentAt(from, content).run();
```

### Feedback Loop
1. User clicks "Revise"
2. Feedback textarea appears
3. User types feedback
4. AI receives: original content + feedback
5. Generates improved version
6. Repeat as needed

### Context Extraction
```typescript
// Get 500 chars before/after cursor
const { from } = editor.state.selection;
const fullText = editor.getText();
const contextStart = Math.max(0, from - 500);
const contextEnd = Math.min(fullText.length, from + 500);
const context = fullText.substring(contextStart, contextEnd);
```

## Where to Find It

**In Your App:**
1. Open any document in the editor
2. Click the AI chat icon (if available)
3. AI panel opens on the right
4. New Cursor-style interface loads automatically

**The chat replaces:** The previous MultiAIChat component in the ResizableAIPanel

## How to Test

1. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open a document**

3. **Position cursor** where you want content

4. **Open AI chat panel**

5. **Try these prompts:**
   - "Write a short battle scene"
   - "Describe a mysterious forest"
   - "Create dialogue between two characters arguing"

6. **Test the workflow:**
   - See AI response
   - Click "Accept" → Content appears at cursor!
   - Or click "Revise" → Give feedback → Get improved version

## Example Session

```
You: Write a tense scene where Sarah discovers the truth

AI: Sarah's hands trembled as she unfolded the letter.
    The words blurred before her eyes, but their meaning
    was crystal clear. Everything she'd been told was a lie...

    [×Decline] [⟳Revise] [✓Accept]

You click "Revise"
You type: "Make it more shocking and add her physical reaction"

AI: Sarah's breath caught in her throat. The letter slipped
    from her numb fingers, floating to the ground like a death
    sentence. Her legs gave out and she sank to her knees.
    Everything—every word, every promise, every truth she'd
    built her life on—was nothing but an elaborate lie...

    [×Decline] [⟳Revise] [✓Accept]

You click "Accept"
→ Content appears in your document at cursor!
→ ✓ Accepted confirmation
→ Keep writing from there!
```

## Differences from Previous Chat

| Feature | Old (MultiAIChat) | New (CursorStyleChat) |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Focus** | Multi-purpose | Pure content generation |
| **UI** | Complex tabs, saved chats | Simple, focused |
| **Workflow** | Chat → Preview → Insert | Chat → Accept/Decline/Revise |
| **Persistence** | Saved to Firebase | Session-only |
| **Actions** | Multiple options | 3 clear actions |
| **Goal** | General AI assistant | Fast content creation |

## Benefits

### 🚀 Faster Writing
- Quick generation
- Instant insertion
- No modal popups
- Streamlined workflow

### 🎯 Better Control
- Accept what works
- Decline what doesn't
- Revise what's close
- Stay in flow

### 💡 Iterative Improvement
- First draft from AI
- Revise with feedback
- Iterate until perfect
- Accept when ready

### 🔄 Simple Learning Curve
- 3 buttons
- Clear purpose
- Obvious actions
- No complexity

## Configuration

All settings are in `CursorStyleChat.tsx`:

```typescript
// Context window (chars before/after cursor)
const contextStart = Math.max(0, from - 500);
const contextEnd = Math.min(fullText.length, from + 500);

// Can be adjusted for more/less context
```

## Styling

Dark theme by default (`CursorStyleChat.scss`):
- Matches editor aesthetic
- Easy on eyes
- Professional look
- Customizable colors

## Known Limitations

1. **No Chat History:** Chats don't persist between sessions
   - **Reason:** Focus on generation, not conversation
   - **Benefit:** Fresh start every time, no clutter

2. **Single Document Focus:** Works on active document only
   - **Reason:** Simplicity and clarity
   - **Benefit:** Always inserts where you expect

3. **No Undo in Chat:** Can't undo revisions
   - **Reason:** Linear workflow
   - **Benefit:** Forward progress
   - **Workaround:** Can always revise again or decline

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Possible additions if needed:
- [ ] Save favorite prompts
- [ ] Template library
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for Accept/Decline
- [ ] Voice input
- [ ] Multiple responses to choose from
- [ ] Export chat as notes
