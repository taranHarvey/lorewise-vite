## Features Implemented

### âœ… Visual Diff Highlighting
- Green highlights for additions
- Red highlights with strikethrough for deletions
- Yellow highlights for replacements
- Inline marks in the editor content

### âœ… Accept/Reject Interface
- Individual change approval buttons
- Bulk accept/reject all
- Visual change cards with rationale
- Numbered changes for easy reference

### âœ… Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+Shift+A`: Accept next change
- `Ctrl+Shift+R`: Reject next change
- `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`: Accept all
- `Shift+Escape`: Reject all

### âœ… Selection-Based Editing
- Extract user's text selection
- Capture surrounding context (500 chars before/after)
- Pass to AI for context-aware edits

### âœ… Change Management
- Track multiple pending changes
- Apply changes sequentially
- Revert rejected changes
- Persist accepted changes

### âœ… AI Integration Ready
- Structured AI response format (AIEditResponse)
- Support for 8 AI action types:
  - Improve
  - Expand
  - Shorten
  - Rephrase
  - Continue
  - Check Consistency
  - Enhance Dialogue
  - Enhance Description

### âœ… Cross-Document Support
- Works in book editor (TiptapEditor)
- Works in lore editor (LoreEditor)
- Consistent experience across both

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User selects text in the editor
2. User triggers an AI action (e.g., "Improve")
3. System sends selection + context + lore to AI
4. AI returns structured edits (JSON)
5. System applies edits as visual highlights
6. Diff sidebar appears showing all changes
7. User reviews each change with rationale
8. User accepts or rejects changes individually or in bulk
9. Accepted changes become permanent, rejected changes are removed

### Technical Flow
```
User Selection
    â†“
useDiffEditor.getSelection()
    â†“
useDiffEditor.getContext()
    â†“
AI Service (your implementation)
    â†“
AIEditResponse (JSON)
    â†“
useDiffEditor.processAIResponse()
    â†“
DiffExtension marks applied
    â†“
DiffVisualization displays changes
    â†“
User accepts/rejects
    â†“
Changes applied or reverted
```

## Next Steps to Complete Integration

### 1. Update Your AI Service
Modify `src/services/aiService.ts` to return the `AIEditResponse` format:

```typescript
export async function generateEdits(
  action: string,
  selectedText: string,
  context: string,
  lore?: any
): Promise<AIEditResponse> {
  // Your AI API call here
  // Must return: { success: boolean, edits: [...], error?: string }
}
```

### 2. Add AI Action Triggers
You can either:
- Use the provided `AIDiffIntegration` component
- Create custom buttons/slash commands
- Add to existing AI menus

Example:
```typescript
import { AIDiffIntegration } from './components/AI/AIDiffIntegration';

// In your editor component
<AIDiffIntegration
  editor={editor}
  lore={lore}
  onAIRequest={yourAIService.generateEdits}
/>
```

### 3. Import the CSS
Add to your main CSS/SCSS file:
```css
@import './styles/diff-highlights.css';
```

Or import in your component:
```typescript
import '../styles/diff-highlights.css';
```

### 4. Test the System
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open a document
3. Select some text
4. Trigger an AI action
5. Verify diff sidebar appears
6. Test accept/reject buttons
7. Test keyboard shortcuts

## AI Response Format Reference

Your AI must return:

```typescript
{
  "success": true,
  "edits": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id-1",
      "type": "replace" | "insert" | "delete",
      "range": {
        "start": 0,  // Character position in document
        "end": 10    // Character position in document
      },
      "oldText": "original text",
      "newText": "improved text",
      "rationale": "Brief explanation of why this change improves the writing"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Optional overall summary of changes"
}
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts Quick Reference

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Shift+A` | Accept first/next change |
| `Ctrl+Shift+R` | Reject first/next change |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` | Accept ALL changes |
| `Shift+Escape` | Reject ALL changes |

*Note: Use `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl` on macOS*

## Architecture Benefits

### Modular Design
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easy to extend or customize
- Reusable across different editors

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript support
- Strict interfaces for AI responses
- Editor type safety through TipTap

### Performance
- Only re-renders when changes occur
- Efficient diff calculation
- Debounced auto-save (doesn't conflict with diffs)

### User Experience
- Visual feedback for all actions
- Non-destructive editing (preview before commit)
- Keyboard-first workflow
- Rationale for each change

## Customization Options

### Change Colors
Edit `src/components/DiffVisualization/DiffVisualization.scss`:
```scss
.diff-change-type--insert {
  background: rgba(YOUR_COLOR);
  color: YOUR_COLOR;
}
```

### Add New AI Actions
Edit `src/components/AI/AIDiffIntegration.tsx`:
```typescript
const AI_ACTIONS = [
  // ... existing actions
  {
    type: 'your_action',
    label: 'Your Action',
    description: 'What it does'
  }
];
```

### Custom Keyboard Shortcuts
Edit `src/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` or create new shortcuts:
```typescript
useKeyboardShortcuts([
  {
    key: 'x',
    ctrlKey: true,
    callback: yourCustomAction
  }
], true);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Changes not appearing
- Check if DiffExtension is in the editor's extensions array
- Verify AI response format matches AIEditResponse
- Check console for errors

### Issue: Keyboard shortcuts not working
- Ensure useDiffKeyboardShortcuts is called
- Check that pendingChanges.length > 0
- Look for conflicting shortcuts

### Issue: Styles not applied
- Import diff-highlights.css
- Check if SCSS is being compiled
- Verify CSS bundle includes the styles
